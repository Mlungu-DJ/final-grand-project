🌱 Project Title:
Soil Fertility Predictor for Crop Suitability

📄 Project Description:
This application will analyze soil parameters (like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH, moisture, etc.) and predict the fertility level of the soil. Based on the analysis, it will recommend suitable crops or soil improvement actions.

🎯 Project Objectives:
Accept soil data as input (manual entry or CSV upload).

Analyze nutrient levels and classify fertility (e.g., low, medium, high).

Recommend suitable crops for the fertility level.

Visualize nutrient levels using charts or gauges.

Optional: Use machine learning for more accurate crop suggestions.

🧰 Tools & Technologies:
Frontend: Streamlit or Flask (for UI)

Backend: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy – data handling

matplotlib, plotly – visualizations

scikit-learn – optional machine learning

Dataset: Soil fertility dataset (can use from Kaggle, ICRISAT, or government agricultural sources)

🏗️ Suggested App Features:
Upload/Enter Soil Data:

N, P, K, pH, Moisture, EC, Organic Carbon.

Fertility Level Detection:

Basic rules (threshold-based) or trained ML classifier.

Crop Recommendation:

Based on fertility levels and crop nutrient requirements.

Charts:

Radar chart or bar graph of nutrient levels vs ideal ranges.

Insights:

Suggest fertilizers, soil treatment, or irrigation advice.
